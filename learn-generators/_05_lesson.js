/*
  Look sync. Do async.

  ## Info

  Generators allow us to hide the asynchronicity as an implementation
  detail and write easy-reading, maintainable, synchronous-looking code.

  Wat?

  Generators can pause their execution while async calls complete.

  For example, you want to read current directory with fs.readdir(dir, cb)
  with no falling back to callback land:
*/

var fs = require('fs');

function run (generator) {
  var it = generator(go);

  // callback function
  function go (err, result) {
    it.next(result);
  }

  go();  
}

run(function* (done) {
  // read `learn-generators` exercises folder
  var exercises = yield fs.readdir('exercises', done);
  console.log(exercises); // [ 'look_sync_do_async', ..., 'run_stop_run' ]
});


/*
  Here we create a generator that stops and waits for readdir to finish.

  The key to making this work is the run function. The flow in run is:

  1) create new generator-iterator object (it);
  2) define the go function, which calls it.next;
  3) pass go to the new generator-iterator object;
  4) run go once with no arguments to start the generator

  In total go is called twice, once with no arguments (which starts the
  generator's execution) and second with the results of the fs call
  from the yield.

  If this doesn't make sense try inserting console.log statements and try to
  trace the execution flow of the program.
