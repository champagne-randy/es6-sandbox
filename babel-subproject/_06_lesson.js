/*
  Two new keywords called let and const allow the definition of variables in a block scope. Traditional variables defined with var have always been defined for the whole function scope. The restriction of a block scope means that let/const are defined to be used within curly braces { ... }.

  Variables defined with let are changeable but const doesn't allow reassignments. const is much like Java's final keyword.

// block.js
{
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
  const tmp = a;
  a = b;
  b = tmp;
  // tmp = 30; Can't do that, will result in a SyntaxError
}

// a = 20„ÄÅa is defined with `var` so it is accessible outside of the scope
console.log(a);
// variables defined with `let` are not available. This will result in: ReferenceError b is not defined
console.log(b);
// Same goes for const: tmp is not defined
console.log(tmp);


/*
  Using let and const is recommended because it's harder to leak variables to outer scopes.
