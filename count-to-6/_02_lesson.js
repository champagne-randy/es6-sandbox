/*
	ES6 template strings are a new string syntax, which use backticks ( `` ) instead of quotation marks ( '' or "" ). Template strings give you more powerful abilities for constructing strings. They allow string interpolation, with syntax like:
*/

`Hello, ${person}! 1 + 1 = ${1 + 1}!`

/*
	They can also be multiline, simply by placing linebreaks inside your string:
*/

`Hello,
world!`
